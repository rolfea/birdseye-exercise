# Birds Eye

An exercise in executing on some wireframes.

## How I Made This

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## I want to see this in action

This is not deployed anywhere, so to check out what I did, run the
following:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000/landingpage](http://localhost:3000/landingpage)
to view it in the browser.

The Task View (not very complete at this point) can be found
[here](http://localhost:3000/taskview)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## The Exercise

I want to take a pass at implementing these two sketches:

* [The "Task View" page](https://cl.ly/5d7546792d76)
* [The "Landing Page"](https://cl.ly/c916e05f60b3)

After my initial spike of work, I won't have a complete application, but this
should show a decomposition of the above designs, a clean commit history, and
some tests.
